<p class="bn-inline-content"></p><p class="bn-inline-content"><u>Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) [4]</u></p><p class="bn-inline-content">Flashbacks, a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), involve the involuntary re-experiencing of intrusive memories from a past traumatic event. These memories are characterized by a temporal distortion, making them feel as if they are happening in the present moment, leading individuals to react as if the trauma were occurring again. Flashbacks are described as brief, vivid, and rich in sensory details by PTSD patients [5]. It's suggested that heightened activity in the anterior insula contributes to these reliving experiences, implying its role in the time distortion reported during flashbacks [6].</p>
