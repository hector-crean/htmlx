<p class="bn-inline-content">Research consistently indicates that individuals with PTSD tend to avoid external reminders
    of their trauma, such as specific places and activities. This avoidant coping strategy is closely tied to the
    severity of PTSD symptoms. By steering clear of external triggers, individuals hinder the natural processing of
    traumatic memories and the subsequent reduction of associated negative emotions, reinforcing the perception of
    danger associated with those memories<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">15</a>. Additionally, studies suggest that
    females tend to exhibit more pronounced avoidance, highlighting gender differences in PTSD symptomatology<a
