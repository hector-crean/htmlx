<p class="bn-inline-content">Individuals with PTSD commonly experience sleep disturbances, including posttraumatic
    nightmares<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">11</a>. These nightmares often involve re-enactments of the trauma.
    Awakenings from these nightmares are accompanied by intense fear or anxiety, leading to difficulty returning to
    sleep, contributing to excessive fatigue, concentration difficulties, irritability, and feelings of helplessness,
    negatively impacting quality of life. Despite existing therapies, nightmares can persist for decades and may prompt
    avoidance behaviors before bedtime, exacerbating insomnia and daytime dysfunction<a

    suicidality<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">13</a>.</p>
