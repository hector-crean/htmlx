These nightmares often involve re-enactments of the trauma. Awakenings from these nightmares are accompanied by intense fear or anxiety, leading to difficulty returning to sleep, contributing to excessive fatigue, concentration difficulties, irritability, and feelings of helplessness, negatively impacting quality of life. Despite existing therapies, nightmares can persist for decades and may prompt avoidance behaviors before bedtime, exacerbating insomnia and daytime dysfunction [12]. Additionally, research has linked nightmares to a significant increase in suicidality [13].</p>
