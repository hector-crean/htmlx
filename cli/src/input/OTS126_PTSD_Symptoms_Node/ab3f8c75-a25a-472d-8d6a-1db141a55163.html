These cues can be anything that reminds the individual of the traumatic event, such as sights, sounds, smells, or even certain thoughts or emotions [7]. These triggers can involuntarily bring back unwanted memories of the event, leading to repetitive and distressing recollections that disrupt mental well-being [8].</p>
