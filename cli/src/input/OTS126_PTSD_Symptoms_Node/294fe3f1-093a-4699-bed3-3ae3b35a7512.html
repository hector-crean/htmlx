<p>Arousal symptoms are associated with increased activity in the <span class="bg-[#3283a8]">amygdala</span>, and
    decreased activity in the medial <span class="bg-[#9C548C]">prefontal cortex</span><a
        aria-describedby="ref-marker">4</a>. In healthy individuals,
    prefrontal brain regions regulate
    anger and aggression, while subcortical areas like the <span class=" bg-[#3283a8]">amygdala</span> and ventral
    <span class="bg-[#00FF00]">striatum</span> may heighten these emotions. It
    is hypothesized that reduced prefrontal control over subcortical regions in PTSD could predispose individuals to
    angry and aggressive behavior<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">22</a>. Heightened sensory reactivity may arise from
    chronic increases in dopaminergic
    and noradrenergic levels in PTSD, which suppress sensory gating and enhance sensory cortical activity<a
