<p><strong>Exaggerated startle response</strong></p>
<p>The acoustic startle response (ASR) is a subcortical reflex modulated by neural systems
    implicated in PTSD. Research indicates that individuals with a history of childhood abuse, whether it involves
    significant levels of physical or sexual abuse, exhibit a heightened startle response compared to those who
    experienced lower levels of abuse. The long-lasting effects of early life trauma contribute to an elevated risk of
    developing psychological issues in adulthood<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">35</a>.</p>
