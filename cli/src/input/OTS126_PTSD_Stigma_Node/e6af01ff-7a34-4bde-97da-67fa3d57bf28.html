<p>Due to the stigma surrounding PTSD, individuals with the condition may be looked down upon
    by others. People may hold false beliefs about PTSD, causing them to treat those with the condition and their
    families differently. Unfortunately, stigma can also extend to other aspects of a person's identity, including race,
    sexuality, gender identity, religion, and disability status [2] [4].</p>
<p></p>
<p>Misconceptions about mental health symptoms and PTSD can lead to stigmatization by families
    and the broader community. Additionally, society often associates the condition with military veterans and violence,
    adding further stigma to PTSD, and reinforcing the assumption that it only affects military veterans or those who
    have experienced violence [2] [6].</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even well-intentioned people may feel uncomfortable upon learning someone has PTSD, making
    it difficult for that person to find a job or housing [4].</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stigma occurs when others [4]:</p>
