<h3 class="bn-inline-content">Substance use</h3>
<p class="bn-inline-content">The self-medication theory is the leading explanation for the connection between substance
    use and PTSD. According to this theory, individuals with PTSD are more likely to turn to alcohol or drugs to cope
    with the distressing symptoms and consequences of their condition, increasing their risk of substance use [11].
    Substance use is more common among men than women [12]. Veterans with PTSD have an increased risk of substance use
    disorders [13].</p>
