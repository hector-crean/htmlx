<p class="bn-inline-content"></p><h3 class="bn-inline-content">Anxiety</h3><p class="bn-inline-content">Individuals with PTSD are more likely to have an anxiety disorder, with odds ranging from 2.4 to 7.1 times higher [4]. Anxiety is often triggered by reminders of the traumatic event and can result in pervasive feelings of worry and apprehension [2]. The most prevalent among these anxiety disorders include phobias such as simple, social, and agoraphobia, as well as generalized anxiety disorder [2] [4]. Research also indicates that individuals with PTSD may be at a higher risk of developing OCD. Experiences of trauma and violation may lead to heightened sensitivity to perceived mental contamination and a feeling of 'dirtinessâ€™ that may contribute to the development or exacerbation of OCD symptoms [16].</p>
