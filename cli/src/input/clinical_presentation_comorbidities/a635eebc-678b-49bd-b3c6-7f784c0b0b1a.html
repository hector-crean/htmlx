<h3>Anxiety</h3>
<p>Individuals with PTSD are more likely to have an anxiety disorder, with odds ranging from
    2.4 to 7.1 times higher<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">4</a>. Anxiety is often triggered by reminders of the
    traumatic event and can result in pervasive feelings of worry and apprehension<a
        aria-describedby="ref-marker">2</a>. The most prevalent among these anxiety disorders include phobias such as
    simple, social, and agoraphobia, as well as generalized anxiety disorder<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">2</a><a
        aria-describedby="ref-marker">4</a>. Research also indicates that individuals with PTSD may be at a higher risk
    of developing OCD. Experiences of trauma and violation may lead to heightened sensitivity to perceived mental
    contamination and a feeling of 'dirtinessâ€™ that may contribute to the development or exacerbation of OCD symptoms<a
