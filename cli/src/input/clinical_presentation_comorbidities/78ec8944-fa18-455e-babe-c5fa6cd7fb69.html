<p class="bn-inline-content"></p><h3 class="bn-inline-content">Sleep dysfunction</h3><p class="bn-inline-content">70-87% of patients diagnosed with PTSD experience sleep disturbances, including insomnia, posttraumatic nightmares, awakenings, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [10] [17] [18]. Posttraumatic nightmares often involve reliving the trauma and can lead to intense fear or anxiety upon waking, making it difficult to return to sleep [19]. Awakenings in PTSD may not always be linked to distressing dreams. About 33% of PTSD patients also suffer from PLMD, which can cause awakenings [18]. Insomnia symptoms are reported by approximately 70% of patients and are often related to increased autonomic arousal and fear of sleep, including fear of losing control or experiencing nightmares [18]. OSA is also common among PTSD patients, affecting 40-90% of patients [18].</p>
