<h3>Chronic pain</h3>
<p>PTSD and chronic pain co-occur through various mechanisms. In PTSD, catastrophizing,
    characterized by magnifying pain or trauma severity, feeling overwhelmed, and expecting the worst outcome, amplifies
    trauma perception and emotional distress. Individuals experiencing this may exhibit less control over their pain and
    a greater emotional impact<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">20</a>. Additionally, dysregulated cortisol levels may
    increase sensitivity to pain<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">21</a>. Individuals experiencing both chronic pain and
    posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tend to suffer from more intense pain and reduced quality of life compared to
    those solely dealing with chronic pain. Both conditions are closely linked, with high occurrences of chronic pain in
    PTSD patients and vice versa. Moreover, individuals with this dual diagnosis are commonly prescribed opioid
    medications for pain relief, putting them at a higher risk for opioid use<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">22</a>.
