<p class="bn-inline-content">The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is the gold standard used to both
    diagnose PTSD and measure the severity of its symptoms.</p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"></p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"><strong>Structured Interview:</strong> CAPS-5 is a structured set of 30 questions assessing
    the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, ensuring consistency in how PTSD symptoms are assessed.</p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"></p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"><strong>Diagnosis and Severity: </strong>It serves two purposes: making a categorical
    diagnosis of PTSD and provide a measure of PTSD symptom severity, rating PTSD symptoms on a 5-point based scale,
    ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (extreme/incapacitating).</p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"></p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"><strong>Comprehensive Evaluation: </strong>Beyond just identifying symptoms, it assesses
    when symptoms started, how long they have lasted, the distress they cause, their impact on daily life, any changes
    since the last assessment, and the overall severity of the condition.</p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"></p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"><strong>Dissociative Subtype: </strong>The tool also checks for specific features of a
    dissociative subtype of PTSD, such as depersonalization (feeling detached from oneself) and derealization (feeling
    detached from reality).</p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"></p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"><strong>Process: </strong>The CAPS was designed to be administered by clinicians and
    clinical researchers who have a working knowledge of PTSD but can also be administered by appropriately trained
    paraprofessionals. The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer.</p>
