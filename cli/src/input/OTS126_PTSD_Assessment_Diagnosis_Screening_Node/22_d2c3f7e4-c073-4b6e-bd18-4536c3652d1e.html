        <p class="bn-inline-content">If an individual screens positive for PTSD, further assessment is necessary.
            Ideally, this follow-up assessment should be done using a structured interview, such as the
            Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). However, if this is unavailable, additional assessment
            using a validated self-report measure, such as the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), is recommended.</p>
