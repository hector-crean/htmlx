<p class="bn-inline-content">The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale (CSI) is a tool used by clinicians to evaluate
    and track patients' progress and treatment responses over time. It is composed of two components and is used for
    monitoring purposes.</p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"></p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"><strong>CGI-Severity (CGI-S): </strong>This component uses a 7-point scale to rate the
    current severity of the patient's illness. The clinician evaluates how severe the illness is at the time of
    assessment.</p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"></p>
<p class="bn-inline-content"><strong>CGI-Improvement (CGI-I): </strong>This component rates the change in the patient's
    condition since the beginning of treatment. It helps in determining how much the patient's condition has improved or
    worsened over time.</p>
