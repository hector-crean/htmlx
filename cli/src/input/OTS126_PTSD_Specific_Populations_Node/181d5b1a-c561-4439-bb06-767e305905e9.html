<p><strong>PTSD in Women</strong></p>
<p>In the general population, women are 2x as likely as men to develop PTSD, partly due to their increased exposure to
    traumatic events closely associated with PTSD, such as sexual abuse and rape<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">1</a>.
    Women account for 66.4% of the
    overall PTSD population in the US<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">6</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Even after adjusting for differences in trauma exposure and prior victimization or abuse history, women still exhibit
    a significantly elevated risk of developing PTSD compared to men, with a lifetime prevalence of PTSD of 13% in women
    and 6% in men, suggesting a higher susceptibility among women<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">6</a>. Generic
    research suggests a greater heritability
    risk in women, with genes like adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 (pituitary) receptor (ADCYAP1R1) showing
    allelic variations linked to PTSD risk<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">1</a>. Ultimately, the heightened prevalence
    of PTSD among women likely arises
    from a combination of increased trauma exposure and inherent vulnerabilities<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">1</a>.
    Additionally, females in the
    general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than males<a aria-describedby="ref-marker">5</a>. </p>
