Generic research suggests a greater heritability risk in women, with genes like adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 (pituitary) receptor (ADCYAP1R1) showing allelic variations linked to PTSD risk [1]. Ultimately, the heightened prevalence of PTSD among women likely arises from a combination of increased trauma exposure and inherent vulnerabilities [1]. Additionally, females in the general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than males [5]. ","styles":{}}],"children":[]}]}
