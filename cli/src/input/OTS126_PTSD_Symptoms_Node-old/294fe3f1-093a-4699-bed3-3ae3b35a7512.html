In healthy individuals, prefrontal brain regions regulate anger and aggression, while subcortical areas like the amygdala and ventral striatum may heighten these emotions. It is hypothesized that reduced prefrontal control over subcortical regions in PTSD could predispose individuals to angry and aggressive behavior [22]. Heightened sensory reactivity may arise from chronic increases in dopaminergic and noradrenergic levels in PTSD, which suppress sensory gating and enhance sensory cortical activity [23].</p>
