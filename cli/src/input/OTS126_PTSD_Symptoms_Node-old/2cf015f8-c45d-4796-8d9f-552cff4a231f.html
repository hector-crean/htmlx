Research indicates that individuals with a history of childhood abuse, whether it involves significant levels of physical or sexual abuse, exhibit a heightened startle response compared to those who experienced lower levels of abuse. The long-lasting effects of early life trauma contribute to an elevated risk of developing psychological issues in adulthood [35].</p>
