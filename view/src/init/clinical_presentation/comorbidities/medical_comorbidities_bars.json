Posttraumatic nightmares often involve reliving the trauma and can lead to intense fear or anxiety upon\r\n    waking, making it difficult to return to sleep [19]. Awakenings in PTSD may not always be linked to distressing\r\n    dreams. About 33% of PTSD patients also suffer from PLMD, which can cause awakenings [18]. Insomnia symptoms are\r\n    reported by approximately 70% of patients and are often related to increased autonomic arousal and fear of sleep,\r\n    including fear of losing control or experiencing nightmares [18]. OSA is also common among PTSD patients, affecting\r\n    40-90% of patients [18].</p>"

In PTSD, catastrophizing, characterized by magnifying pain or trauma severity, feeling overwhelmed, and expecting the worst outcome, amplifies trauma perception and emotional distress. Individuals experiencing this may exhibit less control over their pain and a greater emotional impact [20]. Additionally, dysregulated cortisol levels may increase sensitivity to pain [21]. Individuals experiencing both chronic pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tend to suffer from more intense pain and reduced quality of life compared to those solely dealing with chronic pain. Both conditions are closely linked, with high occurrences of chronic pain in PTSD patients and vice versa. Moreover, individuals with this dual diagnosis are commonly prescribed opioid medications for pain relief, putting them at a higher risk for opioid use [22].</p>"
