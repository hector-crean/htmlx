Anxiety is often triggered by reminders of the traumatic event and can result in pervasive feelings of worry and apprehension [2]. The most prevalent among these anxiety disorders include phobias such as simple, social, and agoraphobia, as well as generalized anxiety disorder [2] [4]. Research also indicates that individuals with PTSD may be at a higher risk of developing OCD. Experiences of trauma and violation may lead to heightened sensitivity to perceived mental contamination and a feeling of 'dirtinessâ€™ that may contribute to the development or exacerbation of OCD symptoms [16].</p>"
