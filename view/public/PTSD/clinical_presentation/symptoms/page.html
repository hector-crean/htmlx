                <p class="bn-inline-content">Flashbacks, a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
                    involve the involuntary re-experiencing of intrusive memories from a past traumatic event. These
                    memories are characterized by a temporal distortion, making them feel as if they are happening in
                    the present moment, leading individuals to react as if the trauma were occurring again. Flashbacks
                    are described as brief, vivid, and rich in sensory details by PTSD patients [5]. It's suggested that
                    heightened activity in the anterior insula contributes to these reliving experiences, implying its
                    role in the time distortion reported during flashbacks [6].</p>

                <p class="bn-inline-content">Individuals with PTSD commonly experience sleep disturbances, including
                    posttraumatic nightmares [11]. These nightmares often involve re-enactments of the trauma.
                    Awakenings from these nightmares are accompanied by intense fear or anxiety, leading to difficulty
                    returning to sleep, contributing to excessive fatigue, concentration difficulties, irritability, and
                    feelings of helplessness, negatively impacting quality of life. Despite existing therapies,
                    nightmares can persist for decades and may prompt avoidance behaviors before bedtime, exacerbating
                    insomnia and daytime dysfunction [12]. Additionally, research has linked nightmares to a significant
                    increase in suicidality [13].</p>

                <p class="bn-inline-content">In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), individuals may experience intense
                    or prolonged psychological distress triggered by external or internal cues related to their
                    traumatic experiences. These cues can be anything that reminds the individual of the traumatic
                    event, such as sights, sounds, smells, or even certain thoughts or emotions [7]. These triggers can
                    involuntarily bring back unwanted memories of the event, leading to repetitive and distressing
                    recollections that disrupt mental well-being [8].</p>

                    which themes or aspects of the traumatic events are re-enacted [10].</p>

                <h3 class="bn-inline-content">Arousal</h3>
                <p class="bn-inline-content">Arousal symptoms are associated with increased activity in the amygdala and
                    insula, and decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex  [4]. In healthy individuals,
                    prefrontal brain regions regulate anger and aggression, while subcortical areas like the amygdala
                    and ventral striatum may heighten these emotions. It is hypothesized that reduced prefrontal control
                    over subcortical regions in PTSD could predispose individuals to angry and aggressive behavior [22].
                    Heightened sensory reactivity may arise from chronic increases in dopaminergic and noradrenergic
                    levels in PTSD, which suppress sensory gating and enhance sensory cortical activity [23].</p>

                <p class="bn-inline-content">Emerging evidence highlights insomnia as a core element of PTSD,
                    mechanistically linked to its onset and persistence. Various mechanisms, such as neurobiological
                    changes, impaired fear extinction, disrupted emotional processing during sleep, and repeated
                    exposure to trauma cues during nightmares, contribute to this connection. These mechanisms elucidate
                    how insomnia obstructs natural recovery from trauma, fosters PTSD development, and hampers response
                    to treatments [24].</p>

                <p class="bn-inline-content">Patients diagnosed with PTSD commonly report challenges related to
                    concentration, attention, and memory. Studies have revealed poorer cognitive performance in
                    individuals with PTSD on tasks assessing attention, declarative memory, and other cognitive
                    functions [25]. Diminished cognitive performance in PTSD may be associated with reductions in
                    hippocampal volume [26] [27].</p>

                <p class="bn-inline-content">The severity of PTSD correlates with challenges in impulse control, often
                    leading to impulsive, reckless, and potentially self-destructive behaviors [28] [29]. These actions
                    can range from substance abuse and risky sexual behaviors to intentional self-harm [30] [31]. A
                    study on Veterans receiving treatment for PTSD revealed that a significant number of deaths were
                    related to substance use, suicide, and homicide [32].</p>

                    environment for potential threats, may exacerbate PTSD symptoms by focusing attention on perceived
                    dangers [33]. Individuals with PTSD often exhibit hypersensitivity to a wide range of sensory

                <p class="bn-inline-content">The acoustic startle response (ASR) is a subcortical reflex modulated by
                    neural systems implicated in PTSD. Research indicates that individuals with a history of childhood
                    abuse, whether it involves significant levels of physical or sexual abuse, exhibit a heightened
                    startle response compared to those who experienced lower levels of abuse. The long-lasting effects
                    of early life trauma contribute to an elevated risk of developing psychological issues in adulthood
