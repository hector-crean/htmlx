- Generate html from an input `blocks.json` file, which is effectivelt an array of `Block` data
- A block, when rendered, is a `block level` element.  `Block data` is the props fed to a specified
render function, which renders the block. We can define our own render function, a bit like how we 
can create different implementations of a react components, which each take the same props.



[ ] Create `blocks` rooms using liveblocks. We create the initial data files (i.e. for more tricky things like tabs etc., which we haven't
    yet got a ui editor for). User can update text
[ ] When ready, we can export the room storage data, and generate an html page from it
[x] Use specta to enforce shared types between rust and typescript
[ ] create html templates for:
        [x] tabs
