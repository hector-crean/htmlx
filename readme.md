- Generate html from an input `blocks.json` file, which is effectivelt an array of `Block` data
- A block, when rendered, is a `block level` element.  `Block data` is the props fed to a specified
render function, which renders the block. We can define our own render function, a bit like how we 
can create different implementations of a react components, which each take the same props.
